## Welcome to GitHub Pages :-ck-chaudhary

Here, The basic and general algorithms of machine learning is uploaded...
Each folder of this repository contains the code corresponding to the mentioned folder name which have fully implemented and tested on the matlab software.
Most of the variable's work is incorporated in the variable name itself to make it easier.
I have also uploaded the corresponding dataset for each of the algorithm implemented.You can variate the dataset looking at the dataset attached which contains 4 features with 3 classes of the Irish Dataset.

Hey, if you find any problems running my code , you can get it clarified by writing it in the issue section mention the algorithm and line number if possible...I will always try to help you out.
